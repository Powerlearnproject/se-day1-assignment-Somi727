# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
designing of the software application
development of the software application
testing of the software application

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning which involves defining the softwares purpose and scope
requirement analysis which seeks to identify and record the precise requirement of final users
design which is about building the framework
coding which involves converting software design to tangible code
testing where vulnerabilites are uncovered
deployment where it is presented to users
maintenance where there is constant assistance and improvement

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall has a fixed timelinewhile agile is more flexible

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developers create software applications and programs' quality assuarance engineer ensures quality of the software application while a project manager evaluates a problem in a code

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
